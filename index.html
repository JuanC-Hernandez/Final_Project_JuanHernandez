            <h4>A Little About Me</h4>
            <p>Hello my name is Juan Carlos Hernandez, I was born in Los Angeles. Lived in California until the age of 13, later I lived in
                Arkansas for 1 year. I have been in the PNW (Seattle Area) for almost 15 years now, and I'm absolutely in love with this state.
                I fell in love with technology at an early age, I remember my dad coming back from work with a really big pc that he had just 
                bought from his job place as they were replacing all computers with new ones. That was the start of a special connection.
